Here we provide evidence for a weakening of the AMOC by about 3 ± 1 sverdrups (around 15 per cent) since the mid-twentieth century. This weakening is revealed by a characteristic spatial and seasonal sea-surface temperature ‘fingerprint’—consisting of a pattern of cooling in the subpolar Atlantic Ocean and warming in the Gulf Stream region—and is&nbsp;calibrated through an ensemble of model simulations from the CMIP5 project. We find this fingerprint both in a high-resolution climate model in response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and in the temperature trends observed since the late nineteenth century. The pattern can be explained by a slowdown in the AMOC and reduced northward heat transport, as well as an associated northward shift of the Gulf Stream. Comparisons with recent direct measurements from the RAPID project and several other studies provide a consistent depiction of record-low AMOC values in recent years.

After the existence of some of the proto-Solutrean and Magdalenian engravings was revealed in Nov. 1994, the valley was saved by local, national and even international protests from inundation by a huge dam that was being erected. Prehistoric Art Emergency contributed to this campaign by collecting signatures that were forwarded to the president of Portugal and distributing a call to arms based on what I discovered during an incursion into the valley and dam-builders’ offices in April 1995. After the defeat of the right-wing government, which had pushed ahead with the construction, the new administration responded to the protest movement by halting the dam in November 1995. Even though the valley was turned into Portugal’s first archaeological park two years later and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998, a number of exquisite panels in the valley remain flooded both because it was already partially inundated by an older dam downstream and because of a coffer dam for the dam that was stopped - which successive governments have never seen fit to remove. In fact, fifteen years later, the valley is still not out of danger! Every three months or so an editorial appears in the Portuguese press saying that one of the biggest mistakes of the former Socialist government was stopping the Côa dam. One of Portugal’s most esteemed archaeologist told me that the park’s adversaries may have worked against a daring proposal to build the museum in the shell of the abandoned dam itself, because that would have prevented the dam-builders from eventually resuming construction! This, he claimed, was the ulterior motive for siting the new museum away from the dam site and even above the valley. Furthermore, he believes they slyly located the costly modern museum outside of town, in a remote location - where it would be poorly served by local infrastructure - to lower its profile and the number of visitors, so they can later say that the museum - and, by extension, the art it represents - are not that important to the public and were the real waste of funds. So, just when one thinks that the artistic cornucopia is safe, one discovers that one can’t let down ones guard. Even after the entire world has recognized the importance of the valley’s art, the dam-builders are apparently waiting for their chance to resume the flooding. But you can help fight them simply by proving them wrong! Every tourist who goes to Côa to see its masterpieces and museum will be literally participating in an on-going battle to save humanity’s heritage from irrevocable destruction! Although visiting the three sites that are open to the public (Canada do Inferno, Penascosa and Ribeira de Piscos) takes a little planning, because of the need to reserve a tour with a licensed guide, it will be worth every moment. The landscapes are so magical, the art so rich, and the story so compelling, that you will be enchanted and involved in a continuing saga. The Park’s own small cadre of guides has received the most training - directly from archaeologists - so I can’t recommend them highly enough. If they are overbooked, though, don’t hesitate to book a tour with one of the private guides listed below. In either case, you will be taken in a small group - with a maximum of eight people - in a four-wheel-drive vehicle to at least one of the sites. It takes between one and a half and three hours to visit each location, so plan to spend a couple of days in the area.

Simmons was commissioned into the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles, a fellow officer of Sir John Kincaid and Sir Harry Smith both of whom left valuable memoirs of the period. A religious and upright man, although not priggish, he kept a journal of the actions movement and events of his life and sent numerous letters home to his family in Hull. These form the narrative which has been ordered by Lt. Col. Verner to flow in sequence through his time fighting Napoleon’s forces.Simmons, and his brothers who often crop up in the volume, was at the forefront of the fighting engaged in by the Light Brigade and later Light Division. He was wounded a number of times, once so seriously at Waterloo as a result of a musket wound to the chest, that his attendants though he might die. He took part in the battles of Fuentes D’Oñoro, Salamanca, Vittoria, the Nivelle, Orthez and finally Waterloo. The storming of Badajoz, Cuidad Rodrigo are also described in vivid detail missing nothing of the fear, death and mayhem of the attacking troops; to give just one excerpt of the action:- I saw my poor friend Major O'Hare lying dead upon the breach. Two or three musket balls had passed through his breast. A gallant fellow, Sergeant Flemming, was also dead by his side, a man who had always been with him. I called to remembrance poor O'Hare's last words just before he marched off to lead the advance. He shook me by the hand saying, \"A Lieutenant-Colonel or cold meat in a few hours.\" I was now gazing upon his body lying stretched and naked amongst thousands more.An excellent read, contemporaneously written and abounding with interesting details.Author – Major George Simmons [1785-1858]Editor – Lt.-Col Willoughby Cole Verner [1852-1922]"}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://books.google.pt/books?hl=en&lr=&id=h9lvCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT34&dq=Douro+and+the+Peninsular+War+british+accounts&ots=lehSvTjb5j&sig=5nBxzgKB08_NRUaLXtgRHKbnd4Q&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Douro%20and%20the%20Peninsular%20War%20british%20accounts&f=false"},{"guid":"XWsnUwk8LzPp","title":"A Narrative of the Peninsular War -

Episcopal ChurchThe Episcopal Church has said that the theory of evolution does not conflict with Christian faith. In 2006, the General Convention affirmed, via Resolution A129, that God is creator and added that \"the theory of evolution provides a fruitful and unifying scientific explanation for the emergence of life on earth, that many theological interpretations of origins can readily embrace an evolutionary outlook, and that an acceptance of evolution is entirely compatible with an authentic and living Christian faith.\" Church of EnglandThe Church of England is considering the possibility of apologising posthumously to Darwin, for its earlier condemnation of his theory Greek Orthodox ChurchThe Greek Orthodox Church is divided between Compatibilists who hold that science and theology are compatible, and Incompatibilists who hold that science can be incompatible with faith. Many Incompatibilists reject evolution. United Methodist ChurchGeneral Conference, the only entity that speaks for the United Methodist Church, makes these three statements regarding evolution: \"We find that science's descriptions of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution are not in conflict with theology.\" (¶ 160. F. The Book of Discipline 2008)\"The General Conference of The United Methodist Church goes on record as opposing the introduction of any faith-based theories such as Creationism or Intelligent Design into the science curriculum of our public schools.\" (Resolution 5052 of The Book of Resolutions 2008)\"[The United Methodist Church] endorses The Clergy Letter Project and its reconciliatory programs between religion and science, and urges United Methodist clergy participation.\" (From resolution 1027 of The Book of Resolutions 2008)The theological justification is: \"We find that as science expands human understanding of the natural world, our understanding of the mysteries of God's creation and word are enhanced.\" (¶ 160. F. The Book of Discipline 2008)Presbyterian ChurchThe Presbyterian Church (USA) Office of Theology and Worship, 1969 GA-approved theological statement on the subject, evolution and the Bible, stated, \"Neither Scripture, our Confession of Faith, nor our Catechisms, teach the Creation of man by the direct and immediate acts of God so as to exclude the possibility of evolution as a scientific theory.\" However, it appears that the Southern Presbyterians dissent from this view. Mormon ChurchAlthough the Mormon Church has no position on evolution, it has produced a number of official doctrinal statements on the \"origin of man\". These statements generally adopt the position, as a church-approved encyclopedia states, \"[t]he scriptures tell why man was created, but they do not tell how, though the Lord has promised that he will tell that when he comes again\". National Council of Churches USAA National Council of Churches USA committee has released a resource on the teaching of evolution in public school science classes, \"to assist people of faith who experience no conflict between science and religion as they consider the issues around the teaching of evolution.\" Members of the NCC's Committee on Public Education and Literacy represent: the Christian Church, Disciples of Christ; the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church; the Episcopal Church; the Presbyterian Church (USA); the Progressive National Baptist Convention; the United Church of Christ Justice & Witness Ministries; the United Methodist Church General Board of Church and Society; and the United Methodist Women. The Church of the NazareneThe Church of the Nazarene, an evangelical Christian denomination, sees \"knowledge acquired by science and human inquiry equal to that acquired by divine revelation.\" Uniting Church of AustraliaThe Uniting Church of Australia appears to have no official position, but an overwhelming majority of its clergy acknowledge evolution."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.answers.com/Q/What_Christian_denominations_acknowledge_evolution"},{"guid":"7CfU_rBy952r","title":"1936 Dobro Model 35","index":2248,"dateAdded":1654074934276000,"lastModified":1654119336249000,"id":14461,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"resonator","iconuri":"http://denmarkstreetonline.co.uk/denmark-street-guitars.ico","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"1936 Dobro Model 35"}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"http://denmarkstreetonline.co.uk/product-details/1936-Dobro-Model-35"},{"guid":"HCVBY040VrE3","title":"Busker Guitars Home Page - Busker Guitars","index":2249,"dateAdded":1654075093533000,"lastModified":1654119336309000,"id":14468,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"resonator","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Resonator guitar sales."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"http://buskerguitars.co.uk/"},{"guid":"AtMmouCP-yzS","title":"Michael Messer","index":2250,"dateAdded":1654075286604000,"lastModified":1654119336368000,"id":14476,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"resonator","iconuri":"https://d10j3mvrs1suex.cloudfront.net/u/178687/4b94f87331df9846715e45672fd4001854493ed0/original/icon5.png/!!/b%3AW1sicmVzaXplIixbNDgsNDhdXV0%3D/meta%3AeyJzcmNCdWNrZXQiOiJiemdsZmlsZXMifQ%3D%3D.png","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Home page of Michael Messer, a blues artist.

Some believe that sexual preference is a matter of genetic predisposition. Some believe it is a matter of environmental conditions (how one was raised or personal life experiences). Still others believe it is exclusively a matter of choice. The fact of the matter is that there is no easy answer to this, just as there is no easy or pat answer for any aspect of human behavior. It will forever devolve into a discussion of nature vs. nurture. These questions inherently cannot be answered. As support for one side grows, the other will combat it with evidence, anecdotal or actual to refute it.People have suggested that a gay person can become straight by sublimating their desires and practicing heterosexual behavior. There are stories of this being effective for some. There are as many stories of miserable failure. This presumes that homosexuality is exclusively a choice. The fact is that human behavior can be modified by a variety of means. And, it can be done in a lasting and effective way. The psychologists Skinner and Erickson proved that...to some degree and under very specific conditions. (Yeah, pun intended).Some suggest that homosexuality is a condition or disease. This is simply ad hoc/ad hominem argument to support a personal opinion on exclusively moral grounds, an attempt to decide if the behavior is right or wrong. Right or wrong is not the issue. Right or wrong in these matters is exclusively in the purview of those who are or are not gay. If it is right or wrong for them, then only they can answer for it in this world or the next.The simple fact of the matter is that the Nature/Nurture argument is pointless. As human behavior goes, there are no easy answers. One is born with the genetic predisposition for any number of eventualities. For instance, it has been scientifically proven that a gene exists to predispose certain people toward Alcoholism. However, if that person never comes into contact with alcohol, or never takes that first drink, the potential for that person to develop into an alcoholic is 0%. It is a matter of how Nature and Nurture interact.Additionally, human sexual behaviors are to a degree a matter of choice, BUT they are also a matter of biological drive, genetics, culture, biochemistry, psychology, sociology, nutrition, and countless other factors, both internal and external. In the matter of sexual attraction, there is strong recent evidence that suggests humans are printed to be attracted to those who match the general type and appearance of their first intimate experience. To attempt to answer conclusively any question related to human behavior is an exercise in futility, and is a demonstration of that all too familiar human behavior, self-delusion.If you have come to the realization that you are fully gay then there is no way to change yourself. So consider the following:Tip 1 -- there is nothing wrong with being gay. Nothing. Really. It may take you a while to realize this, but it's true.Tip 2 -- chances are, most of what you think you know about being gay is wrong. This isn't your fault: we live in a society where almost everything you hear about gay people is wrong. (It's a lot like being an Afro-American in the South in the 1950's, swimming in a sea of ignorance and fear.) I suggest you read Loving Someone Gay, by Don Clark, and The Homosexual Matrix, but C. A. Tripp for starters.Tip 3 -- a lot of gay people have been where you are now. Get yourself some gay friends -- not sex partners, necessarily, but friends who share some of your interests: fishing, Basketball, movies, whatever. Share your concerns with your friends. If necessary, call a counselor (NOT one who claims they're able to \"cure\" you -- those people are frauds) or find a \"coming out\" support group. Be good to yourself!Tip 4 -- down the road a few years, you will run into a guy or gal who is where you are now: confused, ashamed, scared, and feeling very much alone. Help them!You cannot choose who you love. Being bisexual or gay is not a crime, and you do not choose it. It doesn't change. You can't become straight. Be happy for who you are and don't let others try to change that.No, this is not possible, gay people are just the way they are the same a heterosexuals, the sooner we all realize that and accept it, the better this world would be."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://qa.answers.com/other-qa/Can_a_gay_person_become_straight"},{"guid":"pdlS3G36l1V8","title":"Can a person change from gay to straight? - Answers","index":2360,"dateAdded":1651954652589000,"lastModified":1654119381117000,"id":8865,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"sexuality","iconuri":"https://www.answers.com/icons/192x192.png","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"AnswerNo. God created homosexuals the way they are. AnswerThere are organizations that claim they can turn gays and lesbians into heterosexuals. By and large, however, the people they \"turn\" are those who have internalized the idea it's a bad, terrible thing to be gay and who really would do almost anything to not be what they really are. So they stop and begin to play the part of being straight, they try to convince themselves that they're given up being gay. Very very few of them, practically none, manage to keep this game going for a long time. Most eventually give up, the acting straight when they know they're not becomes too huge a burden and they return to being who they are. Being gay isn't something you decide to be and then later decide not to; it's a deep down, ingrained and real part of your personality, your being. The shame that causes people to want to stop being gay and act straight is all from the outside, from religious leaders, the community and family who all pound into your head that it's \"a sin' and against god.But it's not. It's you and it's who and what you are. Gay people all around the world can attest that accepting who and what you are releases all that self hatred and fear of displeasing others. You become more sane and serene, happy and can finally accept yourself. It is a huge giant boulder of guilt, put there by intolerant people, that you finally get off your shoulders.There are numerous videos on YouTube where ex members of some of these \"change from gay to straight\" organizations explain what they went through (search \"ex-gay\"), the huge lies they lived and tried so desperately to believe but in the end, realized they had to be true to themselves. And they stopped acting straight. And became happy. At last.Seehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2PLPyKmtas&feature=relatedfor a YouTube video of the founder of Exodus who eventually stopped being \"straight\" and became a very vocal opponent of the ex-gay program. Then check out the \"related\" videos on the right for more videos.AnswerNope. Sexual orientation is inborn and cannot be changed. People are born straight (heterosexual), bisexual, or gay (homosexual), and you can't move in between. The existence of bisexuality often confuses naive people about this issue, but a truly straight person and a truly gay person cannot become the other, ever. No, they can't. Homosexuality is genetic, not a choice. Though some would disagree with this and say that homosexuality is a choice and given the right circumstances (for example, abuse or a bad relationship with the opposite sex) a heterosexual may become gay, thus if they can choose to become gay they can then choose to become straight again. There is \"gay therapy\" that is offered to homosexuals in order to \"cure\" them of their homosexuality.AnswerPeople are born gay. A gay person could live a straight lifestyle if they so chose but they would always be gay, they could lie to themselves and others but that would not change the fact that they were gay. Being gay IS NOT a choice I don't care what anyone says. I was born gay and I believe that every gay person was, I don't see why anyone would 'chose' to be a second class citizen or 'chose a lifestyle' that could get them beat up or even killed just because of who they sleep with. Being gay is not easy, it can be a very harsh reality sometimes for some people but to say that a person could become straight just by continuing to date the opposite sex is just absurd and those people that say they ''used to be gay but not anymore'' are not fooling anyone.AnswerIt might be possible to manipulate yourself... but is that really what you want? AnswerTrue Gay People are born that way and are not changed. Please do not go to one of the false places that claims they can change you. Electroshock therapy is not the answer. Answerquick answer: they can't. sorry bud. it's been proven that there is a certain \"gene\" that can trigger the straight/gay thing. i know this for a fact because they took a blood sample from my aunt as a part of a program test and it turned out that in almost every case, the DNA genotype matched the person's gay phenotype. AnswerSort of, but it's not magic. A \"gay\" person could discover that he was not gay, or discover that they were bisexual. That would be a sort of change. But there's no proof that one can just actually change from one to the other."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.answers.com/Q/Can_a_person_change_from_gay_to_straight"},{"guid":"vnMdu-dFvh6_","title":"Frankly My Dear...

In a former life I was a famous preacher in Australia’s mega-churches, such as Hillsong. Believing homosexuality was a sin, I spent 22 years struggling to change my orientation through conversion therapy, exorcisms and 16 years of marriage. My story is not unique though. My autobiography, “A Life of Unlearning” (now in it's 3rd edition) has enabled 1000’s of LGBT people to find resolution, come out and educated others of their struggle. Whilst others may attack individuals and organisations I believe the real enemy is ignorance. I’m passionate about creating change and a better world for LGBTI people. I do this through workshops, my writing, media work, speaking opportunities and creating behind the scenes dialogues. Living a life of passion and purpose is fundamental to me. Inspiring others and making a difference is the outcome."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyvennbrown"},{"guid":"QC0SPYftNRah","title":"Meet the Women Who Pick Up the Pieces After Their Husbands Come Out","index":2365,"dateAdded":1651955131274000,"lastModified":1654119381446000,"id":8885,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"sexuality","iconuri":"https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/apple-touch-icon-152.png","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"The women who pick up the pieces after their husbands come out"}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2015/8/13/meet-women-who-pick-pieces-after-their-husbands-come-out"},{"guid":"sXbYVjMSOiJz","title":"OurPath","index":2366,"dateAdded":1651954774315000,"lastModified":1654119381504000,"id":8871,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"sexuality","iconuri":"https://ourpath.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/favicon.png","type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://ourpath.org/"},{"guid":"xX9LP0M1vf1L","title":"UK government vows to ban 'abhorrent' gay conversion therapy | Euronews","index":2367,"dateAdded":1651969556573000,"lastModified":1654119381565000,"id":9094,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"sexuality","iconuri":"https://static.euronews.com/favicons/android-chrome-192x192.png","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"UK government vows to ban 'abhorrent' gay conversion therapy"}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"http://www.euronews.com/2018/07/03/uk-government-vows-to-ban-abhorrent-gay-conversion-therapy"},{"guid":"9hCGn4E4mmzw","title":"Will the UK’s plans to ban ‘gay conversion therapy’ succeed? | New Scientist","index":2368,"dateAdded":1651969579582000,"lastModified":1654119381632000,"id":9096,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"sexuality","iconuri":"https://www.newscientist.com/build/images/layup/touch-icon/180x180.50b024f6.png","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Similar bans in the US have saved thousands of teens from discredited “treatments”, even though they have loopholes that allow religious advice"}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2173435-will-the-uks-plans-to-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-succeed/"},{"guid":"tK9WU4lmEh3D","title":"Global Shipping and Logistics Services | UPS - Portugal","index":2369,"dateAdded":1654080765975000,"lastModified":1654119391112000,"id":14727,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"shipping","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"UPS® is one of the largest and most trusted Global shipping and logistics companies worldwide.

Even the timing of the first colonization of the Americas remains unresolved, and the lack of clear-cut substantiation of palaeoart finds predating about 12,000 years bp is conspicuous.

Instead there has been a trend, begun over a century ago, to search for presumed depictions of extinct megafauna and the tracks of such species. All these notions have been discredited, however, and the current evidence suggests that figurative depiction was introduced only during the Holocene, never reaching Tasmania. Nevertheless, some Australian rock art has been attributed to the Pleistocene by direct dating methods, and its nature implies that a significant portion of the surviving corpus of rock art may also be of such age. In particular much of Australian cave art is of the Ice Age, or appears to be so, and any heavily weathered or patinated petroglyphs on particularly hard rocks are good candidates for Pleistocene antiquity.
