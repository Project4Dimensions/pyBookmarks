With compassion he has promoted communication across generations as well as revealing a path of understanding and reconciliation for parents, siblings, husbands and wives as well as among religious leaders, teachers, librarians, legislators, judges, and law enforcement agencies. Most important he has provided vital insight into the psychodynamics and sociology of individuals, the gay men and lesbians who have been and continue to be misunderstood and abused in societies around the world.  He has said: ''In this age of global misunderstanding in which we see old habits of prejudice and bigotry coming into question finally, the world cries out for communication and empathy. The time has come for any person who believes she or he is rational to offer a helping hand to a gay sister or brother, here or there, known or unknown. Previously unquestioned rules are changing. No person is free to dare to be exactly who she or he is until that person is willing to offer understanding, respect and affection to the gay person who yearns only for that same freedom.''   With this latest updated edition of his famous book, Dr. Clark shines a clear light into our future in the twenty-first century.\n\nBuy Loving Someone Gay Updated and REV by Clark, Don, Clark, Donald H.

Here we provide evidence for a weakening of the AMOC by about 3 ± 1 sverdrups (around 15 per cent) since the mid-twentieth century. This weakening is revealed by a characteristic spatial and seasonal sea-surface temperature ‘fingerprint’—consisting of a pattern of cooling in the subpolar Atlantic Ocean and warming in the Gulf Stream region—and is&nbsp;calibrated through an ensemble of model simulations from the CMIP5 project. We find this fingerprint both in a high-resolution climate model in response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and in the temperature trends observed since the late nineteenth century. The pattern can be explained by a slowdown in the AMOC and reduced northward heat transport, as well as an associated northward shift of the Gulf Stream. Comparisons with recent direct measurements from the RAPID project and several other studies provide a consistent depiction of record-low AMOC values in recent years.

After the existence of some of the proto-Solutrean and Magdalenian engravings was revealed in Nov. 1994, the valley was saved by local, national and even international protests from inundation by a huge dam that was being erected. Prehistoric Art Emergency contributed to this campaign by collecting signatures that were forwarded to the president of Portugal and distributing a call to arms based on what I discovered during an incursion into the valley and dam-builders’ offices in April 1995. After the defeat of the right-wing government, which had pushed ahead with the construction, the new administration responded to the protest movement by halting the dam in November 1995. Even though the valley was turned into Portugal’s first archaeological park two years later and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998, a number of exquisite panels in the valley remain flooded both because it was already partially inundated by an older dam downstream and because of a coffer dam for the dam that was stopped - which successive governments have never seen fit to remove. In fact, fifteen years later, the valley is still not out of danger! Every three months or so an editorial appears in the Portuguese press saying that one of the biggest mistakes of the former Socialist government was stopping the Côa dam. One of Portugal’s most esteemed archaeologist told me that the park’s adversaries may have worked against a daring proposal to build the museum in the shell of the abandoned dam itself, because that would have prevented the dam-builders from eventually resuming construction! This, he claimed, was the ulterior motive for siting the new museum away from the dam site and even above the valley. Furthermore, he believes they slyly located the costly modern museum outside of town, in a remote location - where it would be poorly served by local infrastructure - to lower its profile and the number of visitors, so they can later say that the museum - and, by extension, the art it represents - are not that important to the public and were the real waste of funds. So, just when one thinks that the artistic cornucopia is safe, one discovers that one can’t let down ones guard. Even after the entire world has recognized the importance of the valley’s art, the dam-builders are apparently waiting for their chance to resume the flooding. But you can help fight them simply by proving them wrong! Every tourist who goes to Côa to see its masterpieces and museum will be literally participating in an on-going battle to save humanity’s heritage from irrevocable destruction! Although visiting the three sites that are open to the public (Canada do Inferno, Penascosa and Ribeira de Piscos) takes a little planning, because of the need to reserve a tour with a licensed guide, it will be worth every moment. The landscapes are so magical, the art so rich, and the story so compelling, that you will be enchanted and involved in a continuing saga. The Park’s own small cadre of guides has received the most training - directly from archaeologists - so I can’t recommend them highly enough. If they are overbooked, though, don’t hesitate to book a tour with one of the private guides listed below. In either case, you will be taken in a small group - with a maximum of eight people - in a four-wheel-drive vehicle to at least one of the sites. It takes between one and a half and three hours to visit each location, so plan to spend a couple of days in the area. If you only speak English, you may also want to ask for a guide who speaks the language - although they all bring along plasticized interpretative documents that show where to look for the fainter engravings and explain their dating. Finally, make sure to take advantage of the spectacular museum’s wealth of audio-visual aides for understanding the art outside.

Parentheses can be dropped if the expression is unambiguous.

It is now often used interchangeably with earlier concepts like business analytics, business intelligence, predictive modeling, and Statistics.  Even the suggestion that data science is sexy was a paraphrased reference to Dr. Hans Rosling’s 2011 BBC documentary quote, “Statistics, is now the sexiest subject around”. Nate Silver referred to data science as a sexed up term for statistics.

It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled “A Mathematical Theory of Communication”. Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include lossless data compression (e.g. ZIP files), lossy data compression (e.g. MP3s and JPEGs), and channel coding (e.g. for digital subscriber line (DSL)). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the Voyager missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones, the development of the Internet, the study of linguistics and of human perception, the understanding of black holes, and numerous other fields.\nA key measure in information theory is “entropy”. Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a die (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are mutual information, channel capacity, error exponents, and relative entropy.\nThe field is at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, neurobiology, and electrical engineering. The theory has also found applications in other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, human vision , the evolution and function of molecular codes (bioinformatics), model selection in statistics, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection.

There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible “reasonable” model of computation (see Church–Turing thesis). It might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but any decidable problem solved by a Turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory.

Simmons was commissioned into the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles, a fellow officer of Sir John Kincaid and Sir Harry Smith both of whom left valuable memoirs of the period. A religious and upright man, although not priggish, he kept a journal of the actions movement and events of his life and sent numerous letters home to his family in Hull. These form the narrative which has been ordered by Lt. Col. Verner to flow in sequence through his time fighting Napoleon’s forces.Simmons, and his brothers who often crop up in the volume, was at the forefront of the fighting engaged in by the Light Brigade and later Light Division. He was wounded a number of times, once so seriously at Waterloo as a result of a musket wound to the chest, that his attendants though he might die. He took part in the battles of Fuentes D’Oñoro, Salamanca, Vittoria, the Nivelle, Orthez and finally Waterloo. The storming of Badajoz, Cuidad Rodrigo are also described in vivid detail missing nothing of the fear, death and mayhem of the attacking troops; to give just one excerpt of the action:- I saw my poor friend Major O'Hare lying dead upon the breach. Two or three musket balls had passed through his breast. A gallant fellow, Sergeant Flemming, was also dead by his side, a man who had always been with him. I called to remembrance poor O'Hare's last words just before he marched off to lead the advance. He shook me by the hand saying, \"A Lieutenant-Colonel or cold meat in a few hours.\" I was now gazing upon his body lying stretched and naked amongst thousands more.An excellent read, contemporaneously written and abounding with interesting details.Author – Major George Simmons [1785-1858]Editor – Lt.-Col Willoughby Cole Verner [1852-1922]"}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://books.google.pt/books?hl=en&lr=&id=h9lvCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT34&dq=Douro+and+the+Peninsular+War+british+accounts&ots=lehSvTjb5j&sig=5nBxzgKB08_NRUaLXtgRHKbnd4Q&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Douro%20and%20the%20Peninsular%20War%20british%20accounts&f=false"},{"guid":"XWsnUwk8LzPp","title":"A Narrative of the Peninsular War -

The word steganography combines the Greek words steganos (στεγανός), meaning “covered, concealed, or protected”, and graphein (γράφειν) meaning “writing”.\nThe first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his Steganographia, a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a shared secret are forms of security through obscurity, whereas key-dependent steganographic schemes adhere to Kerckhoffs’s principle.\nThe advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages—no matter how unbreakable—arouse interest, and may in themselves be incriminating in countries where encryption is illegal. Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent as well as concealing the contents of the message.\nSteganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography"},{"guid":"B6ts331U1mp5","title":"10 Gigabit Ethernet - Wikipedia","index":909,"dateAdded":1652274115256000,"lastModified":1654111238246000,"id":930,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"encyclopedia","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Gigabit_Ethernet","type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Gigabit_Ethernet"},{"guid":"c6miZCsu1zao","title":"Adjective - Wikipedia","index":910,"dateAdded":1651794720293000,"lastModified":1656611480561000,"id":931,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"encyclopedia","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated adj) is a describing word, the main syntactic role of which is to qualify a noun or noun phrase, giving more information about the object signified.\nAdjectives are one of the English parts of speech, although historically they were classed together with the nouns.

The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization.

The acronym GIS is sometimes used for geographic information science (GIScience) to refer to the academic discipline that studies geographic information systems  and is a large domain within the broader academic discipline of geoinformatics. What goes beyond a GIS is a spatial data infrastructure, a concept that has no such restrictive boundaries.\nIn general, the term describes any information system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares, and displays geographic information. GIS applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, edit data in maps, and present the results of all these operations. Geographic information science is the science underlying geographic concepts, applications, and systems.GIS can refer to a number of different technologies, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications related to engineering, planning, management, transport/logistics, insurance, telecommunications, and business. For that reason, GIS and location intelligence applications can be the foundation for many location-enabled services that rely on analysis and visualization.\nGIS can relate unrelated information by using location as the key index variable. Locations or extents in the Earth space–time may be recorded as dates/times of occurrence, and x, y, and z coordinates representing, longitude, latitude, and elevation, respectively. All Earth-based spatial–temporal location and extent references should be relatable to one another and ultimately to a “real” physical location or extent. This key characteristic of GIS has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system"},{"guid":"6W_-6BNrQyRj","title":"GNU GRUB -

Much of the debate in epistemology centers on four areas: (1) the philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and how it relates to such concepts as truth, belief, and justification, (2) various problems of skepticism, (3) the sources and scope of knowledge and justified belief, and (4) the criteria for knowledge and justification. Epistemology addresses such questions as: “What makes justified beliefs justified?”, “What does it mean to say that we know something?”, and fundamentally “How do we know that we know?”.\nThe term “epistemology” was first used by Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier in 1854. However, according to Brett Warren, King James VI of Scotland had previously personified this philosophical concept as the character Epistemon in 1591."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology"},{"guid":"FmCSd6KyVwS8","title":"Marabi - Wikipedia","index":981,"dateAdded":1654107388411000,"lastModified":1654118369543000,"id":1002,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"kwela,encyclopedia","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marabi","type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marabi"},{"guid":"2N8NL0aoREpp","title":"Mango Groove - Wikipedia","index":982,"dateAdded":1653662377260000,"lastModified":1654118369610000,"id":1003,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"kwela,music,encyclopedia","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango_Groove","type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango_Groove"},{"guid":"fqOJA3byLKTt","title":"Jack 'Big Voice' Lerole : A Swinging Safari - YouTube","index":983,"dateAdded":1653828127291000,"lastModified":1654118369674000,"id":1004,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"musician,encyclopedia,kwela","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49XSsXJqudg","type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49XSsXJqudg"},{"guid":"WLCxjoMF4ZrL","title":"Kachamba Brothers - Where can i get Emery? - YouTube","index":984,"dateAdded":1653828152249000,"lastModified":1654118369729000,"id":1005,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"musician,encyclopedia,kwela","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuKlbQYf3q0","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"from a Gerhard Kubik's rec in the village Singano.

Long term issues may include difficulties in creating and keeping relationships, maintaining a job, and performing daily tasks.The cause of autism spectrum is uncertain. Risk factors include having an older parent, a family history of the condition, and certain genetic conditions. Diagnosis is based on symptoms. The DSM-5 redefined the autism spectrum disorders to encompass the previous diagnoses of autism, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and childhood disintegrative disorder. Treatment efforts are generally individualized to the person’s condition. Medications may be used to try to help improve certain associated problems. Evidence to support the use of medications, however, is not very strong. Autism spectrum is estimated to affect about 1% of people (62.2 million globally as of  2015).

These patterns develop early, are inflexible, and are associated with significant distress or disability. The definitions may vary somewhat, according to source. Official criteria for diagnosing personality disorders are listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the fifth chapter of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which are the world’s two most dominant diagnostic systems. Personality, defined psychologically, is the set of enduring behavioral and mental traits that distinguish individual humans. Hence, personality disorders are defined by experiences and behaviors that differ from social norms and expectations. Those diagnosed with a personality disorder may experience difficulties in cognition, emotiveness, interpersonal functioning, or impulse control. In general, personality disorders are diagnosed in 40–60% of psychiatric patients, making them the most frequent of psychiatric diagnoses. Personality disorders are characterized by an enduring collection of behavioral patterns often associated with considerable personal, social, and occupational disruption. Personality disorders are also inflexible and pervasive across many situations, largely due to the fact that such behavior may be ego-syntonic (i.e. the patterns are consistent with the ego integrity of the individual) and are therefore perceived to be appropriate by that individual. This behavior can result in maladaptive coping skills and may lead to personal problems that induce extreme anxiety, distress, or depression. These behaviour patterns are typically recognized in adolescence, the beginning of adulthood or sometimes even childhood and often have a pervasive negative impact on the quality of life. Many issues occur with classifying a personality disorder. Because the theory and diagnosis of personality disorders occur within prevailing cultural expectations, their validity is contested by some experts on the basis of inevitable subjectivity. They argue that the theory and diagnosis of personality disorders are based strictly on social, or even sociopolitical and economic considerations."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder"},{"guid":"Fw_AC9uVqe7m","title":"Psychology - Wikipedia","index":1078,"dateAdded":1651937550842000,"lastModified":1656527891961000,"id":1099,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"psychology,encyclopedia","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Psychology is the science of behavior and mind, including conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as feeling and thought. It is an academic discipline of immense scope and diverse interests that, when taken together, seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of epiphenomena they manifest. As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.\nPsychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some—especially clinical and counseling psychologists—at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a “hub science” in that medicine tends to draw psychological research via neurology and psychiatry, whereas social sciences most commonly draws directly from sub-disciplines within psychology. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings (e.g., medical schools, hospitals). Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings, or in other areas such as human development and aging, sports, health, and the media, as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"guid":"W_4V7tm2cu38","title":"Psychopathy - Wikipedia","index":1079,"dateAdded":1651937574514000,"lastModified":1656527718607000,"id":1100,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"psychology,encyclopedia","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Psychopathy, sometimes considered synonymous with sociopathy, is traditionally defined as a personality disorder characterized by persistent antisocial behavior, impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits.

Cleckley, an American psychiatrist, influenced the initial diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality reaction/disturbance in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), as did American psychologist George E. Partridge. The DSM and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) subsequently introduced the diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and dissocial personality disorder (DPD) respectively, stating that these diagnoses have been referred to (or include what is referred to) as psychopathy or sociopathy. The creation of ASPD and DPD was driven by the fact that many of the classic traits of psychopathy were impossible to measure objectively. Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare later repopularized the construct of psychopathy in criminology with his Psychopathy Checklist. Although no psychiatric or psychological organization has sanctioned a diagnosis titled “psychopathy”, assessments of psychopathic characteristics are widely used in criminal justice settings in some nations and may have important consequences for individuals. The study of psychopathy is an active field of research, and the term is also used by the general public,  popular press, and in fictional portrayals.

Various legal jurisdictions in Asia, Europe, and the Americas have passed laws against conversion therapy.\nThe American Psychiatric Association (APA) opposes psychiatric treatment \"based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation\" and describes attempts to change sexual orientation by practitioners as unethical. It also states that debates over the integration of gay and lesbian people have obscured science \"by calling into question the motives and even the character of individuals on both sides of the issue\" and that the advancement of conversion therapy may cause social harm by disseminating unscientific views about sexual orientation. United States Surgeon General David Satcher in 2001 issued a report stating that \"there is no valid scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed\".The highest-profile advocates of conversion therapy today tend to be fundamentalist Christian groups and other organizations which use a religious justification for the therapy rather than speaking of homosexuality as \"a disease\". The main organization advocating secular forms of conversion therapy is the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), which often partners with religious groups.Techniques used in conversion therapy prior to 1981 in the United States and Western Europe included ice-pick lobotomies; chemical castration with hormonal treatment; aversive treatments, such as \"the application of electric shock to the hands and/or genitals\"; \"nausea-inducing drugs ... administered simultaneously with the presentation of homoerotic stimuli\"; and masturbatory reconditioning. More recent clinical techniques used in the United States have been limited to counseling, visualization, social skills training, psychoanalytic therapy, and spiritual interventions such as \"prayer and group support and pressure\", though there are some reports of aversive treatments through unlicensed practice as late as the 1990s. The term reparative therapy has been used as a synonym for conversion therapy in general, but it has been argued that strictly speaking it refers to a specific kind of therapy associated with the psychologists Elizabeth Moberly and Joseph Nicolosi."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy"},{"guid":"jyOPkhcrP1fC","title":"Homosexuality - Wikipedia","index":1109,"dateAdded":1651954819585000,"lastModified":1655123495113000,"id":1130,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"sexuality,encyclopedia","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Homosexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender.  As a sexual orientation, homosexuality is \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions\" to people of the same sex. It \"also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.\"Along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual–homosexual continuum. Scientists do not know what determines an individual's sexual orientation, but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, and do not view it as a choice. They favor biologically-based theories, which point to genetic factors, the early uterine environment, both, or the inclusion of genetic and social factors. Hypotheses for the impact of the post-natal social environment on sexual orientation, however, are weak, especially for males. There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role with regard to sexual orientation. While some people believe that homosexual activity is unnatural, scientific research has shown that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation.The most common terms for homosexual people are lesbian for females and gay for males, though gay is also used to refer generally to both homosexual males and females. The number of people who identify as gay or lesbian and the proportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiences are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons, including many gay or lesbian people not openly identifying as such due to homophobia and heterosexist discrimination. Homosexual behavior has also been documented in many non-human animal species.Many gay and lesbian people are in committed same-sex relationships, though only in the 2010s have census forms and political conditions facilitated their visibility and enumeration. These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects. Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred. Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a global movement towards freedom and equality for gay people, including the introduction of anti-bullying legislation to protect gay children at school, legislation ensuring non-discrimination, equal ability to serve in the military, equal access to health care, equal ability to adopt and parent, and the establishment of marriage equality."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality"},{"guid":"vYOO35RfXN-Y","title":"The Homosexual Matrix - Wikipedia","index":1110,"dateAdded":1651955161101000,"lastModified":1655124064922000,"id":1131,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"sexuality,encyclopedia","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Homosexual_Matrix","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"The Homosexual Matrix is a book by American psychologist Clarence Arthur Tripp, in which the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book was first published in 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.\nThe book was controversial and received many negative reviews. It was criticized for Tripp’s alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. Critics also charged that that Tripp mistakenly claimed that gay men tend to have a larger than average penis size. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that The Homosexual Matrix had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp’s view that erotic feeling depends on resistances to its satisfaction."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Homosexual_Matrix"},{"guid":"Rt5QQPXdQk77","title":"SPARQL -

These data types are based on the Perl programming language, though all commonly used high-level programming languages share very similar concepts. The colon-centered syntax, used to express key-value pairs, is inspired by electronic mail headers as defined in RFC 0822, and the document separator “---” is borrowed from MIME (RFC 2045).  Escape sequences are reused from C, and whitespace wrapping for multi-line strings is inspired from HTML.  Lists and hashes can contain nested lists and hashes, forming a tree structure; arbitrary graphs can be represented using YAML aliases (similar to XML in SOAP).

Episcopal ChurchThe Episcopal Church has said that the theory of evolution does not conflict with Christian faith. In 2006, the General Convention affirmed, via Resolution A129, that God is creator and added that \"the theory of evolution provides a fruitful and unifying scientific explanation for the emergence of life on earth, that many theological interpretations of origins can readily embrace an evolutionary outlook, and that an acceptance of evolution is entirely compatible with an authentic and living Christian faith.\" Church of EnglandThe Church of England is considering the possibility of apologising posthumously to Darwin, for its earlier condemnation of his theory Greek Orthodox ChurchThe Greek Orthodox Church is divided between Compatibilists who hold that science and theology are compatible, and Incompatibilists who hold that science can be incompatible with faith. Many Incompatibilists reject evolution. United Methodist ChurchGeneral Conference, the only entity that speaks for the United Methodist Church, makes these three statements regarding evolution: \"We find that science's descriptions of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution are not in conflict with theology.\" (¶ 160. F. The Book of Discipline 2008)\"The General Conference of The United Methodist Church goes on record as opposing the introduction of any faith-based theories such as Creationism or Intelligent Design into the science curriculum of our public schools.\" (Resolution 5052 of The Book of Resolutions 2008)\"[The United Methodist Church] endorses The Clergy Letter Project and its reconciliatory programs between religion and science, and urges United Methodist clergy participation.\" (From resolution 1027 of The Book of Resolutions 2008)The theological justification is: \"We find that as science expands human understanding of the natural world, our understanding of the mysteries of God's creation and word are enhanced.\" (¶ 160. F. The Book of Discipline 2008)Presbyterian ChurchThe Presbyterian Church (USA) Office of Theology and Worship, 1969 GA-approved theological statement on the subject, evolution and the Bible, stated, \"Neither Scripture, our Confession of Faith, nor our Catechisms, teach the Creation of man by the direct and immediate acts of God so as to exclude the possibility of evolution as a scientific theory.\" However, it appears that the Southern Presbyterians dissent from this view. Mormon ChurchAlthough the Mormon Church has no position on evolution, it has produced a number of official doctrinal statements on the \"origin of man\". These statements generally adopt the position, as a church-approved encyclopedia states, \"[t]he scriptures tell why man was created, but they do not tell how, though the Lord has promised that he will tell that when he comes again\". National Council of Churches USAA National Council of Churches USA committee has released a resource on the teaching of evolution in public school science classes, \"to assist people of faith who experience no conflict between science and religion as they consider the issues around the teaching of evolution.\" Members of the NCC's Committee on Public Education and Literacy represent: the Christian Church, Disciples of Christ; the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church; the Episcopal Church; the Presbyterian Church (USA); the Progressive National Baptist Convention; the United Church of Christ Justice & Witness Ministries; the United Methodist Church General Board of Church and Society; and the United Methodist Women. The Church of the NazareneThe Church of the Nazarene, an evangelical Christian denomination, sees \"knowledge acquired by science and human inquiry equal to that acquired by divine revelation.\" Uniting Church of AustraliaThe Uniting Church of Australia appears to have no official position, but an overwhelming majority of its clergy acknowledge evolution."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.answers.com/Q/What_Christian_denominations_acknowledge_evolution"},{"guid":"7CfU_rBy952r","title":"1936 Dobro Model 35","index":2238,"dateAdded":1654074934276000,"lastModified":1654119336249000,"id":2267,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"resonator","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:http://denmarkstreetonline.co.uk/product-details/1936-Dobro-Model-35","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"1936 Dobro Model 35"}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"http://denmarkstreetonline.co.uk/product-details/1936-Dobro-Model-35"},{"guid":"HCVBY040VrE3","title":"Busker Guitars Home Page - Busker Guitars","index":2239,"dateAdded":1654075093533000,"lastModified":1654119336309000,"id":2268,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"resonator","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Resonator guitar sales."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"http://buskerguitars.co.uk/"},{"guid":"vKh6mm_h62oa","title":"National Style O Brass","index":2240,"dateAdded":1654075299868000,"lastModified":1654119336421000,"id":2270,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"resonator","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.nationalguitars.com/styleo","type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.nationalguitars.com/styleo"},{"guid":"XYXPg-0CpKUN","title":"Recording King","index":2241,"dateAdded":1654075311611000,"lastModified":1654119336479000,"id":2271,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"resonator","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.recordingking.com/","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Beginning as a house brand in the 1930’s for Montgomery Ward, Recording \nKing acoustic guitars and banjos were developed during the Golden Age of \nmusical craftsmanship.

Some believe that sexual preference is a matter of genetic predisposition. Some believe it is a matter of environmental conditions (how one was raised or personal life experiences). Still others believe it is exclusively a matter of choice. The fact of the matter is that there is no easy answer to this, just as there is no easy or pat answer for any aspect of human behavior. It will forever devolve into a discussion of nature vs. nurture. These questions inherently cannot be answered. As support for one side grows, the other will combat it with evidence, anecdotal or actual to refute it.People have suggested that a gay person can become straight by sublimating their desires and practicing heterosexual behavior. There are stories of this being effective for some. There are as many stories of miserable failure. This presumes that homosexuality is exclusively a choice. The fact is that human behavior can be modified by a variety of means. And, it can be done in a lasting and effective way. The psychologists Skinner and Erickson proved that...to some degree and under very specific conditions. (Yeah, pun intended).Some suggest that homosexuality is a condition or disease. This is simply ad hoc/ad hominem argument to support a personal opinion on exclusively moral grounds, an attempt to decide if the behavior is right or wrong. Right or wrong is not the issue. Right or wrong in these matters is exclusively in the purview of those who are or are not gay. If it is right or wrong for them, then only they can answer for it in this world or the next.The simple fact of the matter is that the Nature/Nurture argument is pointless. As human behavior goes, there are no easy answers. One is born with the genetic predisposition for any number of eventualities. For instance, it has been scientifically proven that a gene exists to predispose certain people toward Alcoholism. However, if that person never comes into contact with alcohol, or never takes that first drink, the potential for that person to develop into an alcoholic is 0%. It is a matter of how Nature and Nurture interact.Additionally, human sexual behaviors are to a degree a matter of choice, BUT they are also a matter of biological drive, genetics, culture, biochemistry, psychology, sociology, nutrition, and countless other factors, both internal and external. In the matter of sexual attraction, there is strong recent evidence that suggests humans are printed to be attracted to those who match the general type and appearance of their first intimate experience. To attempt to answer conclusively any question related to human behavior is an exercise in futility, and is a demonstration of that all too familiar human behavior, self-delusion.If you have come to the realization that you are fully gay then there is no way to change yourself. So consider the following:Tip 1 -- there is nothing wrong with being gay. Nothing. Really. It may take you a while to realize this, but it's true.Tip 2 -- chances are, most of what you think you know about being gay is wrong. This isn't your fault: we live in a society where almost everything you hear about gay people is wrong. (It's a lot like being an Afro-American in the South in the 1950's, swimming in a sea of ignorance and fear.) I suggest you read Loving Someone Gay, by Don Clark, and The Homosexual Matrix, but C. A. Tripp for starters.Tip 3 -- a lot of gay people have been where you are now. Get yourself some gay friends -- not sex partners, necessarily, but friends who share some of your interests: fishing, Basketball, movies, whatever. Share your concerns with your friends. If necessary, call a counselor (NOT one who claims they're able to \"cure\" you -- those people are frauds) or find a \"coming out\" support group. Be good to yourself!Tip 4 -- down the road a few years, you will run into a guy or gal who is where you are now: confused, ashamed, scared, and feeling very much alone. Help them!You cannot choose who you love. Being bisexual or gay is not a crime, and you do not choose it. It doesn't change. You can't become straight. Be happy for who you are and don't let others try to change that.No, this is not possible, gay people are just the way they are the same a heterosexuals, the sooner we all realize that and accept it, the better this world would be."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://qa.answers.com/other-qa/Can_a_gay_person_become_straight"},{"guid":"pdlS3G36l1V8","title":"Can a person change from gay to straight? - Answers","index":2349,"dateAdded":1651954652589000,"lastModified":1654119381117000,"id":2379,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"sexuality","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.answers.com/Q/Can_a_person_change_from_gay_to_straight","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"AnswerNo. God created homosexuals the way they are. AnswerThere are organizations that claim they can turn gays and lesbians into heterosexuals. By and large, however, the people they \"turn\" are those who have internalized the idea it's a bad, terrible thing to be gay and who really would do almost anything to not be what they really are. So they stop and begin to play the part of being straight, they try to convince themselves that they're given up being gay. Very very few of them, practically none, manage to keep this game going for a long time. Most eventually give up, the acting straight when they know they're not becomes too huge a burden and they return to being who they are. Being gay isn't something you decide to be and then later decide not to; it's a deep down, ingrained and real part of your personality, your being. The shame that causes people to want to stop being gay and act straight is all from the outside, from religious leaders, the community and family who all pound into your head that it's \"a sin' and against god.But it's not. It's you and it's who and what you are. Gay people all around the world can attest that accepting who and what you are releases all that self hatred and fear of displeasing others. You become more sane and serene, happy and can finally accept yourself. It is a huge giant boulder of guilt, put there by intolerant people, that you finally get off your shoulders.There are numerous videos on YouTube where ex members of some of these \"change from gay to straight\" organizations explain what they went through (search \"ex-gay\"), the huge lies they lived and tried so desperately to believe but in the end, realized they had to be true to themselves. And they stopped acting straight. And became happy. At last.Seehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2PLPyKmtas&feature=relatedfor a YouTube video of the founder of Exodus who eventually stopped being \"straight\" and became a very vocal opponent of the ex-gay program. Then check out the \"related\" videos on the right for more videos.AnswerNope. Sexual orientation is inborn and cannot be changed. People are born straight (heterosexual), bisexual, or gay (homosexual), and you can't move in between. The existence of bisexuality often confuses naive people about this issue, but a truly straight person and a truly gay person cannot become the other, ever. No, they can't. Homosexuality is genetic, not a choice. Though some would disagree with this and say that homosexuality is a choice and given the right circumstances (for example, abuse or a bad relationship with the opposite sex) a heterosexual may become gay, thus if they can choose to become gay they can then choose to become straight again. There is \"gay therapy\" that is offered to homosexuals in order to \"cure\" them of their homosexuality.AnswerPeople are born gay. A gay person could live a straight lifestyle if they so chose but they would always be gay, they could lie to themselves and others but that would not change the fact that they were gay. Being gay IS NOT a choice I don't care what anyone says. I was born gay and I believe that every gay person was, I don't see why anyone would 'chose' to be a second class citizen or 'chose a lifestyle' that could get them beat up or even killed just because of who they sleep with. Being gay is not easy, it can be a very harsh reality sometimes for some people but to say that a person could become straight just by continuing to date the opposite sex is just absurd and those people that say they ''used to be gay but not anymore'' are not fooling anyone.AnswerIt might be possible to manipulate yourself... but is that really what you want? AnswerTrue Gay People are born that way and are not changed. Please do not go to one of the false places that claims they can change you. Electroshock therapy is not the answer. Answerquick answer: they can't. sorry bud. it's been proven that there is a certain \"gene\" that can trigger the straight/gay thing. i know this for a fact because they took a blood sample from my aunt as a part of a program test and it turned out that in almost every case, the DNA genotype matched the person's gay phenotype. AnswerSort of, but it's not magic. A \"gay\" person could discover that he was not gay, or discover that they were bisexual. That would be a sort of change. But there's no proof that one can just actually change from one to the other."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.answers.com/Q/Can_a_person_change_from_gay_to_straight"},{"guid":"vnMdu-dFvh6_","title":"Frankly My Dear...

In a former life I was a famous preacher in Australia’s mega-churches, such as Hillsong.

My autobiography, “A Life of Unlearning” (now in it's 3rd edition) has enabled 1000’s of LGBT people to find resolution, come out and educated others of their struggle. Whilst others may attack individuals and organisations I believe the real enemy is ignorance. I’m passionate about creating change and a better world for LGBTI people. I do this through workshops, my writing, media work, speaking opportunities and creating behind the scenes dialogues. Living a life of passion and purpose is fundamental to me.

Even the timing of the first colonization of the Americas remains unresolved, and the lack of clear-cut substantiation of palaeoart finds predating about 12,000 years bp is conspicuous.

All these notions have been discredited, however, and the current evidence suggests that figurative depiction was introduced only during the Holocene, never reaching Tasmania. Nevertheless, some Australian rock art has been attributed to the Pleistocene by direct dating methods, and its nature implies that a significant portion of the surviving corpus of rock art may also be of such age. In particular much of Australian cave art is of the Ice Age, or appears to be so, and any heavily weathered or patinated petroglyphs on particularly hard rocks are good candidates for Pleistocene antiquity.

With compassion he has promoted communication across generations as well as revealing a path of understanding and reconciliation for parents, siblings, husbands and wives as well as among religious leaders, teachers, librarians, legislators, judges, and law enforcement agencies. Most important he has provided vital insight into the psychodynamics and sociology of individuals, the gay men and lesbians who have been and continue to be misunderstood and abused in societies around the world.  He has said: ''In this age of global misunderstanding in which we see old habits of prejudice and bigotry coming into question finally, the world cries out for communication and empathy. The time has come for any person who believes she or he is rational to offer a helping hand to a gay sister or brother, here or there, known or unknown. Previously unquestioned rules are changing. No person is free to dare to be exactly who she or he is until that person is willing to offer understanding, respect and affection to the gay person who yearns only for that same freedom.''   With this latest updated edition of his famous book, Dr. Clark shines a clear light into our future in the twenty-first century.\n\nBuy 20th Anniversary Edition (Loving Someone Gay) 3 by Clark, Don (ISBN: 0028195878372) from Amazon's Book Store.

In the late 1990s, Lanier worked on applications for Internet2, and in the 2000s, he was a visiting scholar at Silicon Graphics and various universities. From 2006 he began to work at Microsoft, and from 2009 forward he works at Microsoft Research as an Interdisciplinary Scientist.\nLanier has composed classical music and is a collector of rare instruments; his acoustic album, Instruments of Change (1994) features Asian wind and string instruments such as the khene mouth organ, the suling flute, and the sitar-like esraj. Lanier teamed with Mario Grigorov to compose the soundtrack to the documentary film, The Third Wave (2007).

Thin-film solar cells are commercially used in several technologies, including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous thin-film silicon (a-Si, TF-Si).\nFilm thickness varies from a few nanometers (nm) to tens of micrometers (µm), much thinner than thin-film’s rival technology, the conventional, first-generation crystalline silicon solar cell (c-Si), that uses wafers of up to 200 µm. This allows thin film cells to be flexible, and lower in weight. It is used in building integrated photovoltaics and as semi-transparent, photovoltaic glazing material that can be laminated onto windows. Other commercial applications use rigid thin film solar panels (sandwiched between two panes of glass) in some of the world’s largest photovoltaic power stations.\nThin-film technology has always been cheaper but less efficient than conventional c-Si technology. However, it has significantly improved over the years. The lab cell efficiency for CdTe and CIGS is now beyond 21 percent, outperforming multicrystalline silicon, the dominant material currently used in most solar PV systems. Accelerated life testing of thin film modules under laboratory conditions measured a somewhat faster degradation compared to conventional PV, while a lifetime of 20 years or more is generally expected. Despite these enhancements, market-share of thin-film never reached more than 20 percent in the last two decades and has been declining in recent years to about 9 percent of worldwide photovoltaic installations in 2013.Other thin-film technologies that are still in an early stage of ongoing research or with limited commercial availability are often classified as emerging or third generation photovoltaic cells and include organic, dye-sensitized, and polymer solar cells, as well as quantum dot, copper zinc tin sulfide, nanocrystal, micromorph, and perovskite solar cells."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_solar_cell"},{"guid":"KNnE-8iFLcfe","title":"The Lambda Calculus (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Summer 2018 Edition)","index":2718,"dateAdded":1656538287492000,"lastModified":1656538375427000,"id":2751,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"computation,maths,encyclopedia","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"The λλ\\lambda-calculus is, at heart, a simple notation for functionsand application.

The first of six new episodes was broadcast on 8 March 2018.\nThe broad narrative of Hitchhiker follows the misadventures of the last surviving man, Arthur Dent, following the demolition of the planet Earth by a Vogon constructor fleet to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Dent is rescued from Earth’s destruction by Ford Prefect, a human-like alien writer for the eccentric, electronic travel guide The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, by hitchhiking onto a passing Vogon spacecraft. Following his rescue, Dent explores the galaxy with Prefect and encounters Trillian, another human that had been taken from Earth prior to its destruction by the President of the Galaxy, the two-headed Zaphod Beeblebrox, and the depressed Marvin, the Paranoid Android.

A system is a cohesive conglomeration of interrelated and interdependent parts that is either natural or man-made. Every system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose or nature and expressed in its functioning. In terms of its effects, a system can be more than the sum of its parts if it expresses synergy or emergent behavior. Changing one part of the system usually affects other parts and the whole system, with predictable patterns of behavior. For systems that are self-learning and self-adapting, the positive growth and adaptation depend upon how well the system is adjusted with its environment. Some systems function mainly to support other systems by aiding in the maintenance of the other system to prevent failure. The goal of systems theory is systematically discovering a system's dynamics, constraints, conditions and elucidating principles (purpose, measure, methods, tools, etc.) that can be discerned and applied to systems at every level of nesting, and in every field for achieving optimized equifinality.\nGeneral systems theory is about broadly applicable concepts and principles, as opposed to concepts and principles applicable to one domain of knowledge. It distinguishes dynamic or active systems from static or passive systems. Active systems are activity structures or components that interact in behaviours and processes. Passive systems are structures and components that are being processed. E.g. a program is passive when it is a disc file and active when it runs in memory.

Historically, the random variables were associated with or indexed by a set of numbers, usually viewed as points in time, giving the interpretation of a stochastic process representing numerical values of some system randomly changing over time, such as the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. They have applications in many disciplines including sciences such as biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, and physics as well as technology and engineering fields such as image processing, signal processing, information theory, computer science, cryptography and telecommunications. Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.\nApplications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process, used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse, and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time. These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes, and were discovered repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries.\nThe term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process, because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space. The terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables. But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line. If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead. The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects.\nBased on their properties, stochastic processes can be divided into various categories, which include random walks, martingales, Markov processes, Lévy processes, Gaussian processes, random fields, renewal processes, and branching processes. The study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability, calculus, linear algebra, set theory, and topology as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis, measure theory, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis.

He was one of the most prolific French mathematicians of the 20th century. His son, Raphael Douady, is also a mathematician and an economist.\nDouady was a student of Henri Cartan at the École normale supérieure, and initially worked in homological algebra. His thesis concerned deformations of complex analytic spaces. Subsequently, he became more interested in the work of Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia and made significant contributions to the fields of analytic geometry and dynamical systems. Together with his former student John H. Hubbard, he launched a new subject, and a new school, studying properties of iterated quadratic complex mappings. They made important mathematical contributions in this field of complex dynamics, including a study of the Mandelbrot set. One of their most fundamental results is that the Mandelbrot set is connected; perhaps most important is their theory of renormalization of polynomial-like maps.

However, it has proved extremely fruitful and useful to enlarge the number concept to include square roots of negative numbers. The resulting objects are numbers in the sense that arithmetic and algebra can be extended to them in a simple and natural manner; they are imaginary in the sense that their relation to the physical world is less direct than that of the real numbers.

The term can refer to one of several things:\nAs a philosophical practice, it is characterized by an emphasis on argumentative clarity and precision, often making use of formal logic, conceptual analysis, and, to a lesser degree, mathematics and the natural sciences.\nAs a historical development, analytic philosophy refers to certain developments in early 20th-century philosophy that were the historical antecedents of the current practice. Central figures in this historical development are Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, G. E. Moore, Gottlob Frege, and the logical positivists. In this more specific sense, analytic philosophy is identified with specific philosophical traits (many of which are rejected by many contemporary analytic philosophers), such as:\nThe logical-positivist principle that there are not any specifically philosophical facts and that the object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts. This may be contrasted with the traditional foundationalism, which considers philosophy to be a special science (i.e., the discipline of knowledge) that investigates the fundamental reasons and principles of everything. Consequently, many analytic philosophers have considered their inquiries as continuous with, or subordinate to, those of the natural sciences. This is an attitude that begins with John Locke, who described his work as that of an “underlabourer” to the achievements of natural scientists such as Newton. During the 20th century, the most influential advocate of the continuity of philosophy with science was Willard Van Orman Quine.\nThe principle that the logical clarification of thoughts can be achieved only by analysis of the logical form of philosophical propositions. The logical form of a proposition is a way of representing it (often using the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical system), to reduce it to simpler components if necessary, and to display its similarity with all other propositions of the same type. However, analytic philosophers disagree widely about the correct logical form of ordinary language.\nThe neglect of generalized philosophical systems in favour of more restricted inquiries stated rigorously, or ordinary language.\nAccording to a characteristic paragraph by Russell:\nModern analytical empiricism [...] differs from that of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerful logical technique. It is thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve definite answers, which have the quality of science rather than of philosophy. It has the advantage, in comparison with the philosophies of the system-builders, of being able to tackle its problems one at a time, instead of having to invent at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods, in this respect, resemble those of science.\nIn the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Scandinavia, the majority of university philosophy departments today identify themselves as “analytic” departments. Analytic philosophy is often understood in contrast to other philosophical traditions, most notably continental philosophies such as existentialism and phenomenology, and also Thomism and Marxism."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy"},{"guid":"9QRBRwfF1r8E","title":"ANARCHISM | Meaning & Definition for UK English | Lexico.com","index":2744,"dateAdded":1656612450333000,"lastModified":1656612518079000,"id":2777,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"definition,politics","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.lexico.com/definition/anarchism","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"anarchism\nNoun\n1.0: belief in the abolition of all government and the organization of society on a voluntary, cooperative basis without recourse to force or compulsion.\n1.1: a political force or movement based on belief in anarchism.\n\nUK English definition of ANARCHISM along with additional meanings, example sentences, and ways to say."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.lexico.com/definition/anarchism"},{"guid":"mC3H5gxbFGlz","title":"Andiron - Wikipedia","index":2745,"dateAdded":1656612551810000,"lastModified":1656612585620000,"id":2778,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"encyclopedia","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andiron","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"An andiron or firedog, fire-dog or fire dog is a bracket support, normally found in pairs, on which logs are laid for burning in an open fireplace, so that air may circulate under the firewood, allowing better burning and less smoke.

Until the 19th century cast iron was too brittle for many uses, but andirons carried little loads and this was not a problem. From the 18th century fireplaces increasingly had built-in metal grates to hold the firewood, or the coal now increasingly used, up off the floor and in place, thus largely removing the need for andirons. However they were often still kept, for decorative reasons, and sometimes as a place to rest pokers, tongs and other fire implements.\nThey are sometimes called a dog or dog-iron.

As defined in classic philosophy, an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question. As used in modern logic, an axiom is simply a premise or starting point for reasoning.\nAs used in mathematics, the term axiom is used in two related but distinguishable senses: “logical axioms” and “non-logical axioms”. Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define (e.g., (A and B) implies A), often shown in symbolic form, while non-logical axioms (e.g., a + b = b + a) are actually substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as arithmetic). When used in the latter sense, “axiom”, “postulate”, and “assumption” may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory. To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.\nIn both senses, an axiom is any mathematical statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived.

Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically. Some of these human universal patterns are cumulative cultural adaptation, social norms, language, and extensive help and cooperation beyond close kin. It has been argued that the development of these modern behavioral traits, in combination with the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum, was largely responsible for the human replacement of Neanderthals and the peopling of the rest of the world.\nArising from differences in the archaeological record, a debate continues as to whether anatomically modern humans were behaviorally modern as well. There are many theories on the evolution of behavioral modernity. These generally fall into two camps: gradualist and cognitive approaches. The Later Upper Paleolithic Model refers to the idea that modern human behavior arose through cognitive, genetic changes abruptly around 40,000–50,000 years ago.

The butterfly effect describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause a hurricane in Texas.\nSmall differences in initial conditions, such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation, yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general. This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as:\n\nChaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.\n\nChaotic behavior exists in many natural systems, such as weather and climate. It also occurs spontaneously in some systems with artificial components, such as road traffic. This behavior can be studied through analysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and Poincaré maps. Chaos theory has applications in several disciplines, including meteorology, anthropology, sociology, physics, environmental science, computer science, engineering, economics, biology, ecology, and philosophy.

Decision problems typically appear in mathematical questions of decidability, that is, the question of the existence of an effective method to determine the existence of some object or its membership in a set; some of the most important problems in mathematics are undecidable.\nFor example, the problem “given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?” is a decision problem. The answer can be either ‘yes’ or ‘no’, and depends upon the values of x and y. A method for solving a decision problem, given in the form of an algorithm, is called a decision procedure for that problem. A decision procedure for the decision problem “given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?” would give the steps for determining whether x evenly divides y, given x and y. One such algorithm is long division, taught to many school children. If the remainder is zero the answer produced is ‘yes’, otherwise it is ‘no’. A decision problem which can be solved by an algorithm, such as this example, is called decidable.\nThe field of computational complexity categorizes decidable decision problems by how difficult they are to solve. “Difficult”, in this sense, is described in terms of the computational resources needed by the most efficient algorithm for a certain problem.

Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus. For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object’s velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the “instantaneous rate of change”, the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\nDerivatives may be generalized to functions of several real variables. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables. It can be calculated in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables. For a real-valued function of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the gradient vector.\nThe process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.

Ecosystems can be studied in two different ways. They can be thought of as interdependent collections of plants and animals, or as structured systems and communities governed by general rules. The living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components interact through nutrient cycles and energy flows. Ecosystems include interactions among organisms, and between organisms and their environment. Ecosystems can be of any size but each ecosystem has a specific, limited space. Some scientists view the entire planet as one ecosystem.\nEnergy, water, nitrogen and soil minerals are essential abiotic components of an ecosystem. The energy used by ecosystems comes primarily from the sun, via photosynthesis. Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun and also captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Animals also play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through ecosystems. They influence the amount of plant and microbial biomass that lives in the system. As organic matter dies, carbon is released back into the atmosphere. This process also facilitates nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be used again by plants and other microbes.\nEcosystems are controlled by both external and internal factors. External factors such as climate, the parent material that forms the soil, topography and time each affect ecosystems. However, these external factors are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. Ecosystems are dynamic: they are subject to periodic disturbances and are often in the process of recovering from past disturbances and seeking balance. Internal factors are different: They not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. Another way of saying this is that internal factors are subject to feedback loops.\nHumans operate within ecosystems and can influence both internal and external factors. Global warming is an example of a cumulative effect of human activities. Ecosystems provide benefits, called “ecosystem services”, which people depend on for their livelihood.

By the completeness theorem of first-order logic, a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms, so the Entscheidungsproblem can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic.\nIn 1936, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing published independent papers showing that a general solution to the Entscheidungsproblem is impossible, assuming that the intuitive notion of “effectively calculable” is captured by the functions computable by a Turing machine (or equivalently, by those expressible in the lambda calculus).

It holds that the idea of the operation of science by fixed, universal rules is unrealistic, pernicious, and detrimental to science itself.\nThe use of the term anarchism in the name reflected the methodological pluralism prescription of the theory, as the purported scientific method does not have a monopoly on truth or useful results. Feyerabend once famously said that because there is no fixed scientific method, it is best to have an “anything goes” attitude toward methodologies. Feyerabend felt that science started as a liberating movement, but over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid, and therefore had become increasingly an ideology and despite its successes science had started to attain some oppressive features and it was not possible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from religion, magic, or mythology. He felt the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society was authoritarian and ungrounded. Promulgation of the theory earned Feyerabend the title of “the worst enemy of science” from his detractors.\n\nPaul Karl Feyerabend, (January 13, 1924 – February 11, 1994) was an Austrian-born philosopher of science best known for his work as a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked for three decades (1958–1989). At various different points in his life, he lived in England, the United States, New Zealand, Italy, Germany, and finally Switzerland. His major works include Against Method (published in 1975), Science in a Free Society (published in 1978) and Farewell to Reason (a collection of papers published in 1987). Feyerabend became famous for his purportedly anarchistic view of science and his rejection of the existence of universal methodological rules.

It can be defined more formally as the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which the greatest common divisor gcd(n, k) is equal to 1. The integers k of this form are sometimes referred to as totatives of n.\nFor example, the totatives of n = 9 are the six numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8. They are all relatively prime to 9, but the other three numbers in this range, 3, 6, and 9 are not, because gcd(9, 3) = gcd(9, 6) = 3 and gcd(9, 9) = 9. Therefore, φ(9) = 6. As another example, φ(1) = 1 since for n = 1 the only integer in the range from 1 to n is 1 itself, and gcd(1, 1) = 1.\nEuler's totient function is a multiplicative function, meaning that if two numbers m and n are relatively prime, then φ(mn) = φ(m)φ(n).

First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as Socrates is a man one can have expressions in the form “there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man” and there exists is a quantifier while X is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations.\nA theory about a topic is usually a first-order logic together with a specified domain of discourse over which the quantified variables range, finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold for those things. Sometimes “theory” is understood in a more formal sense, which is just a set of sentences in first-order logic.\nThe adjective “first-order” distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which one or both of predicate quantifiers or function quantifiers are permitted. In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.\nThere are many deductive systems for first-order logic which are both sound (all provable statements are true in all models) and complete (all statements which are true in all models are provable). Although the logical consequence relation is only semidecidable, much progress has been made in automated theorem proving in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several metalogical theorems that make it amenable to analysis in proof theory, such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem.\nFirst-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into axioms and is studied in the foundations of mathematics. Peano arithmetic and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory are axiomatizations of number theory and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic. No first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain, such as the natural numbers or the real line. Axioms systems that do fully describe these two structures (that is, categorical axiom systems) can be obtained in stronger logics such as second-order logic.\nThe foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by Gottlob Frege and Charles Sanders Peirce. For a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic, see José Ferreirós (2001)."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic"},{"guid":"h0UCicEjnxIK","title":"FORENAME | Meaning & Definition for UK English | Lexico.com","index":2797,"dateAdded":1656675565239000,"lastModified":1656675605322000,"id":2830,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"definition","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.lexico.com/definition/forename","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"forename\nNoun\n1.0: another term for first name.\n\nUK English definition of FORENAME along with additional meanings, example sentences, and ways to say."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.lexico.com/definition/forename"},{"guid":"nQrZTv1pVPGI","title":"Functional programming - Wikipedia","index":2798,"dateAdded":1656675684197000,"lastModified":1656675726767000,"id":2831,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"encyclopedia,programming","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.\nFunctional programming has its origins in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate computability, the Entscheidungsproblem, function definition, function application, and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus. Another well-known declarative programming paradigm, logic programming, is based on relations.\nIn contrast, imperative programming changes state with commands in the source code, the simplest example being assignment. Imperative programming does have subroutine functions, but these are not functions in the mathematical sense. They can have side effects that may change the value of program state. Functions without return values therefore make sense. Because of this, they lack referential transparency, i.e., the same language expression can result in different values at different times depending on the state of the executing program.\nFunctional programming languages have largely been emphasized in academia rather than in commercial software development. However, prominent programming languages that support functional programming such as Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language (also known as Mathematica), Racket, Erlang, OCaml, Haskell, and F# have been used in industrial and commercial applications by a wide variety of organizations. JavaScript, one of the world's most widely distributed languages, has the properties of an untyped functional language, in addition to imperative and object-oriented paradigms. Functional programming is also supported in some domain-specific programming languages like R (statistics), J, K and Q from Kx Systems (financial analysis), XQuery/XSLT (XML), and Opal. Widespread domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex/Yacc use some elements of functional programming, especially in eschewing mutable values.\nProgramming in a functional style can also be accomplished in languages that are not specifically designed for functional programming. For example, the imperative Perl programming language has been the subject of a book describing how to apply functional programming concepts. This is also true of the PHP programming language. C++11, Java 8, and C# 3.0 all added constructs to facilitate the functional style. The Julia language also offers functional programming abilities. An interesting case is that of Scala – it is frequently written in a functional style, but the presence of side effects and mutable state place it in a grey area between imperative and functional languages."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"guid":"jnl-dhZ7LkSW","title":"Fusiform Definition & Meaning | Dictionary.com","index":2799,"dateAdded":1656675757035000,"lastModified":1656675791764000,"id":2832,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"definition","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fusiform","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"Fusiform means spindle-shaped, rounded and tapering from the middle toward each end, as some roots.\n\nFusiform definition, spindle-shaped; rounded and tapering from the middle toward each end, as some roots.

Attributed to American philosopher Edmund Gettier, Gettier-type counterexamples (called “Gettier-cases”) challenge the long-held justified true belief (JTB) account of knowledge. The JTB account holds that knowledge is equivalent to justified true belief; if all three conditions (justification, truth, and belief) are met of a given claim, then we have knowledge of that claim. In his 1963 three-page paper titled “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?”, Gettier attempts to illustrate by means of two counterexamples that there are cases where individuals can have a justified, true belief regarding a claim but still fail to know it because the reasons for the belief, while justified, turn out to be false. Thus, Gettier claims to have shown that the JTB account is inadequate; that it does not account for all of the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge.\nThe term “Gettier problem”, “Gettier case”, or even the adjective “Gettiered”, is sometimes used to describe any case in the field of epistemology that purports to repudiate the JTB account of knowledge.\nResponses to Gettier’s paper have been numerous; some reject Gettier’s examples, while others seek to adjust the JTB account of knowledge and blunt the force of these counterexamples.

Using data from later Middle Pleistocene archaeological sites in East Africa, this paper tests and falsifies the core assumption of the behavioral-modernity concept—the belief that there were significant differences in behavioral variability between the oldest H. sapiens and populations younger than 50 kya.

That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, information is always conveyed as the content of a message.\nInformation can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation (for example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs, or transmitted via a sequence of signals). It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication.\nInformation reduces uncertainty. The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence and is inversely proportional to that. The more uncertain an event, the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event. The bit is a typical unit of information, but other units such as the nat may be used.

In these contexts an interpretation is a function that provides the extension of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate T (for “tall”) and assign it the extension {a} (for “Abraham Lincoln”). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant T, and does not make a claim about whether T is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘not’. Though we may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.\nAn interpretation often (but not always) provides a way to determine the truth values of sentences in a language.

The percentage of households is plotted on the x-axis, the percentage of income on the y-axis. It can also be used to show distribution of assets. In such use, many economists consider it to be a measure of social inequality.\nThe concept is useful in describing inequality among the size of individuals in ecology and in studies of biodiversity, where the cumulative proportion of species is plotted against the cumulative proportion of individuals.

More precisely, one considers a periodic orbit with initial conditions within a section of the space, which leaves that section afterwards, and observes the point at which this orbit first returns to the section. One then creates a map to send the first point to the second, hence the name first recurrence map. The transversality of the Poincaré section means that periodic orbits starting on the subspace flow through it and not parallel to it.\nA Poincaré map can be interpreted as a discrete dynamical system with a state space that is one dimension smaller than the original continuous dynamical system. Because it preserves many properties of periodic and quasiperiodic orbits of the original system and has a lower-dimensional state space, it is often used for analyzing the original system in a simpler way. In practice this is not always possible as there is no general method to construct a Poincaré map.\nA Poincaré map differs from a recurrence plot in that space, not time, determines when to plot a point. For instance, the locus of the Moon when the Earth is at perihelion is a recurrence plot; the locus of the Moon when it passes through the plane perpendicular to the Earth's orbit and passing through the Sun and the Earth at perihelion is a Poincaré map. It was used by Michel Hénon to study the motion of stars in a galaxy, because the path of a star projected onto a plane looks like a tangled mess, while the Poincaré map shows the structure more clearly."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_map"},{"guid":"T-DBdQrH2oAL","title":"Polynomial - Wikipedia","index":2850,"dateAdded":1656688764429000,"lastModified":1656688816668000,"id":2883,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"encyclopedia,maths","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables.\nPolynomials appear in a wide variety of areas of mathematics and science.

Web Services that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of web services, such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.\n“Web resources” were first defined on the World Wide Web as documents or files identified by their URLs. However, today they have a much more generic and abstract definition that encompasses every thing or entity that can be identified, named, addressed, or handled, in any way whatsoever, on the web. In a RESTful web service, requests made to a resource's URI will elicit a response that may be in HTML, XML, JSON, or some other format. The response may confirm that some alteration has been made to the stored resource, and the response may provide hypertext links to other related resources or collections of resources. When HTTP is used, as is most common, the operations available are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other predefined CRUD HTTP methods.\nBy using a stateless protocol and standard operations, REST systems aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow, by re-using components that can be managed and updated without affecting the system as a whole, even while it is running.\nThe term representational state transfer was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation. Fielding’s dissertation explained the REST principles that were known as the “HTTP object model” beginning in 1994, and were used in designing the HTTP 1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) standards. The term is intended to evoke an image of how a well-designed Web application behaves: it is a network of Web resources (a virtual state-machine) where the user progresses through the application by selecting links, such as /user/tom, and operations such as GET or DELETE (state transitions), resulting in the next resource (representing the next state of the application) being transferred to the user for their use."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"},{"guid":"4e7RwYrQxaqy","title":"RESONANCE | Meaning & Definition for UK English | Lexico.com","index":2867,"dateAdded":1656690586552000,"lastModified":1656690626947000,"id":2900,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"definition","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.lexico.com/definition/resonance","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"resonance\n\nNoun\n1.\na: the quality in a sound of being deep, full, and reverberating.\n\nUK English definition of RESONANCE along with additional meanings, example sentences, and ways to say."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.lexico.com/definition/resonance"},{"guid":"hfSyjvNe2SdZ","title":"RESONATE | Meaning & Definition for UK English | Lexico.com","index":2868,"dateAdded":1656690654126000,"lastModified":1656690698378000,"id":2901,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"definition","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.lexico.com/definition/resonate","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"resonate\n\nVerb\n1.\n a: produce or be filled with a deep, full, reverberating sound, produce electrical or mechanical resonance.\n\nUK English definition of RESONATE along with additional meanings, example sentences, and ways to say."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.lexico.com/definition/resonate"},{"guid":"Lntl3g-cd6bB","title":"REVERBERATE | Meaning & Definition for UK English | Lexico.com","index":2869,"dateAdded":1656690786758000,"lastModified":1656690814992000,"id":2902,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"definition","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://www.lexico.com/definition/reverberate","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"reverberate\n\nVerb\n1.\nSynonyms\na: resound, echo, re-echo, repeat, resonate, pulsate, vibrate, ring, peal, boom, rumble, roll, pound, thump, drum, thrum.\n\nUK English definition of REVERBERATE along with additional meanings, example sentences, and ways to say."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://www.lexico.com/definition/reverberate"},{"guid":"oAqvWeL2CWZe","title":"Rhetorical question - Wikipedia","index":2870,"dateAdded":1656690862151000,"lastModified":1656690907054000,"id":2903,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"encyclopedia","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"A rhetorical question is a figure of speech in the form of a question that is asked to make a point rather than to elicit an answer.

These are principles of the scientific method, as opposed to a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.\nThough there are diverse models for the scientific method available, in general there is a continuous process that includes observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The most conclusive testing of hypotheses comes from reasoning based on carefully controlled experimental data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.\nAlthough procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, they are frequently the same from one to another. The process of the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.\nThe purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis. Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles. Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order. Some philosophers and scientists have argued that there is no scientific method; they include physicist Lee Smolin and philosopher Paul Feyerabend (in his Against Method). Robert Nola and Howard Sankey remark that “For some, the whole idea of a theory of scientific method is yester-year’s debate, the continuation of which can be summed up as yet more of the proverbial deceased equine castigation.

The resulting organization is wholly decentralized, distributed over all the components of the system. As such, the organization is typically robust and able to survive or self-repair substantial perturbation. Chaos theory discusses self-organization in terms of islands of predictability in a sea of chaotic unpredictability.\nSelf-organization occurs in many physical, chemical, biological, robotic, and cognitive systems.

The standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, most fundamentally the Resource Description Framework (RDF). According to the W3C, \"The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries\". The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content, information applications and systems.\nThe term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data (or data web) that can be processed by machines—that is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept.\nBerners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web as follows:\n\nI have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.\n\nThe 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: \"This simple idea…remains largely unrealized\".

It is concerned with the relationship between signifiers—like words, phrases, signs, and symbols—and what they stand for, their denotation.\nIn international scientific vocabulary semantics is also called semasiology. The word semantics was first used by Michel Bréal, a French philologist. It denotes a range of ideas—from the popular to the highly technical. It is often used in ordinary language for denoting a problem of understanding that comes down to word selection or connotation. This problem of understanding has been the subject of many formal enquiries, over a long period of time, especially in the field of formal semantics. In linguistics, it is the study of the interpretation of signs or symbols used in agents or communities within particular circumstances and contexts. Within this view, sounds, facial expressions, body language, and proxemics have semantic (meaningful) content, and each comprises several branches of study. In written language, things like paragraph structure and punctuation bear semantic content; other forms of language bear other semantic content.\nThe formal study of semantics intersects with many other fields of inquiry, including lexicology, syntax, pragmatics, etymology and others. Independently, semantics is also a well-defined field in its own right, often with synthetic properties. In the philosophy of language, semantics and reference are closely connected. Further related fields include philology, communication, and semiotics. The formal study of semantics can therefore be manifold and complex.\nSemantics contrasts with syntax, the study of the combinatorics of units of a language (without reference to their meaning), and pragmatics, the study of the relationships between the symbols of a language, their meaning, and the users of the language. Semantics as a field of study also has significant ties to various representational theories of meaning including truth theories of meaning, coherence theories of meaning, and correspondence theories of meaning. Each of these is related to the general philosophical study of reality and the representation of meaning. In 1960s psychosemantic studies became popular after Osgood’s massive cross-cultural studies using his semantic differential (SD) method that used thousands of nouns and adjective bipolar scales. A specific form of the SD, Projective Semantics method uses only most common and neutral nouns that correspond to the 7 groups (factors) of adjective-scales most consistently found in cross-cultural studies (Evaluation, Potency, Activity as found by Osgood, and Reality, Organization, Complexity, Limitation as found in other studies). In this method, seven groups of bipolar adjective scales corresponded to seven types of nouns so the method was thought to have the object-scale symmetry (OSS) between the scales and nouns for evaluation using these scales. For example, the nouns corresponding to the listed 7 factors would be: Beauty, Power, Motion, Life, Work, Chaos, Law. Beauty was expected to be assessed unequivocally as “very good” on adjectives of Evaluation-related scales, Life as “very real” on Reality-related scales, etc. However, deviations in this symmetric and very basic matrix might show underlying biases of two types: scales-related bias and objects-related bias. This OSS design meant to increase the sensitivity of the SD method to any semantic biases in responses of people within the same culture and educational background."}],"type":"text/x-moz-place","uri":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics"},{"guid":"FD2wNp42XFyS","title":"Sequence - Wikipedia","index":2881,"dateAdded":1656692086475000,"lastModified":1656692126068000,"id":2915,"typeCode":1,"charset":"UTF-8","tags":"encyclopedia,maths","iconuri":"fake-favicon-uri:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence","annos":[{"name":"bookmarkProperties/description","flags":0,"expires":4,"value":"In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed. Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the sequence. Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order matters. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either the set of the natural numbers (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first n natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length n). The position of an element in a sequence is its rank or index; it is the integer from which the element is the image. It depends on the context or of a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1. When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the nth element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with n as subscript; for example, the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence is generally denoted Fn.\nFor example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last. This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence. Sequences can be finite, as in these examples, or infinite, such as the sequence of all even positive integers (2, 4, 6, ...). In computing and computer science, finite sequences are sometimes called strings, words or lists, the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in computer memory; infinite sequences are called streams.

More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about the “big questions” in life, such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife.
